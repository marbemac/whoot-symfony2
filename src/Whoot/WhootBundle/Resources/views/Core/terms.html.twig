        <p>
        The Whoot http://www.thewhoot.com (the "Product") is owned and operated by Ryan Coyne, William Quartner and Marc MacLeod ("the Company"), and is provided to you ("You") under the terms and conditions of these Online Terms of Service ("Terms"), which include the Companyâ€™s Online Privacy Policy and Registration Form that are available through the hyperlinks set forth below and are incorporated herein by reference.

        1. DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT. The Whoot is a new social media outlet which allows users to browse through their numerous friends to see which of those friends; Raging, Having a Relaxed Night Out, Staying In, or Working that night. The Whoot pertains solely to the night ahead and not to any other time in the past, present or distant future. If you already know where you are going and what you are doing that night, The Whoot allows you to broadcast an open invitation to all of the users that follow you so they can get involved in your plans. If some of the people you follow haven't decided what they are doing, just PING them. Pinging a user sends a message to them alerting them that one of their friends wants to know what they are thinking for that night. Pinging is anonymous and far easier than attempting to text everyone you know. The Whoot is very organized an extremely simple. Filter your friends by what their plan is, sort your friends to see who has most recently posted, or create groups of friends so you can easily see what different social circles are thinking for that night.
